## Future Features


## Project Bugs and Solutions:
 
*  terminal wasnt working when used the command line.
* tried to display/print game board with a for loop. 
* number input wassnt catching invalid entries. 
* tried using player input outside varible. but coudnt
* when game checked for tie or winner, game wasnt ending. 
* found solution from stackoverflow to redefine the varible using global.
* userinput needs fursther verifications for non integer.
* when played, game was not folllowing through logic. like announced if player o won. or anounces if tie and end game. tried several solutions. fixed with help from tutors
* when press 2 to quit game, game was not quiting, tried making a function called quit all that sets gameplaying to false. unfortunaly that didnt help at all. i tried so many solutions and playd arround with code stubburly for hours. In the end i googled and found the solution was so simple all along. a build in function called quit() can be used or another called exit() amongst other solutions. i was gobsmacked but super happy

* check tie wasnt working. fixed it by removing additional winner arguent.
* persistant error of when player chooses to play gaian, current player becomes "o". when it shoud've been "x". fixxed this persistant error by re defining current player on both main function and play again or not function and setting current player to "x".
